## Overview
Welcome! This blog is an attempt to merge concepts from neuromedicine, including psychiatry, with mathematical modeling. 

The content here is heavily inspired by my experience as an MD/PhD student at Emory and GeorgiaTech but I hope that the worlds of medicine, mathematics, and engineering find themselves intersecting more often as time goes on. There's a lot that the fields can learn from each other.

### Regression for Confounds in Electrophysiology
In this post, I try to outline why visual inspection of electrophysiology can be very misleading in trying to find correlations with disease. This approach, common in clinical biometrics searches, can give rise to many false negatives. The goal is to promote a systematic approach using modern signal processing tools. [Let's dive in](posts/RegrPreProc/RegrPreproc.md)

### Blind Source Separation
My first post for MinS will be a concept I've been trying to blog-post up for a while. It's still a work in progress, so feedback very welcome. Here we will be focused on some techniques for dimensionality reduction in the context of blind source separation. [Take a look](posts/BSS/BlindSourceSep.md).
