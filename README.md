### Dynamical Systems Modeling

Dynamics is defined as X. To me, it's more than that. It's a well-developed, beautiful language that can be used to describe how something evolves. Sometimes, it evolves in time. Sometimes, it evolves in space. These two things, time and space, have, in themselves, different structure and, critically, *different dynamics*. Time, for us, moves in one direction. Space, on the other hand, doesn't have a preferred dimension. Evolution in time is called *dynamics*, but the basic language of *change* applies to everything.

Dynamics is a critical concept to explain (a) why fields like medicine seem to be moving so slow in their building up of understanding, (b) complex behaviors of simple and complex systems.
